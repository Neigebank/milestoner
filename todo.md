<h2>Current stuff to do</h2>

Everything in the version 0.0.5 milestone in the issues tab, which is to say:
* Add a save button in the options tab, along with autosaving.
* Add a way to enable/disable autosaving, in the options tab.
* Add an export button "alert" (to say that it has been copied to clipboard).
* Reorganize a bit of the code, in styles.css (group the different rules together).

The list here is somewhat ranked in order of importance, with saving being the most import the favicon being the least.
